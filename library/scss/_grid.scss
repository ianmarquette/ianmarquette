Stylesheet: Grid Stylesheet

I've seperated the grid so you can swap it out easily. It's
called at the top the style.scss stylesheet.

There are a ton of grid solutions out there. You should definitely
experiment with your own. Here are some recommendations:

http://gridsetapp.com - Love this site. Responsive Grids made easy.
http://susy.oddbird.net/ - Grids using Compass. Very elegant.
http://gridpak.com/ - Create your own responsive grid.

The grid below is a combination of the 1140 grid and Twitter Boostrap. 
I liked 1140 but Boostrap's grid was way more detailed so I merged them 
together, let's see how this works out. If you want to use 1140, the original 
values are commented out on each line.

.onecol    { width: 15%;  }			/* grid_1 */
.twocol    { width: 32%; }          /* grid_2 */
.threecol  { width: 49%; }          /* grid_3 */
.fourcol   { width: 66%; }          /* grid_4 */
.fivecol   { width: 83%; }          /* grid_5 */
.sixcol    { width: 100%; }         /* grid_6 */

// layout & column defaults
.onecol, .twocol, .threecol, .fourcol, .fivecol, .sixcol {
  position: relative;
}

.first {
  margin-left: 0;
}

.last {
  float: right;
}
